#Notes:
Tree-Nodes need to have following elements 
Directories:
1.:parent    pointer     => Every element has that, If null, you are in / (root)
2.:name      char   => Identifying name
3.memory     int         => file has static memory, parents of file have ... either (NULL) or sum of child-memory
4.children   Node*[]     => Array of pointers to child elements
5.top        int         => Top of children array
write function to add elements to nodes, write function to move in tree (change active element)


#Learning: 
strdup allocates memory and copies string. use this to copy a string to a 
memory allocated struct, otherwise it will use the same address and therefore each 
struct will use the same string as their attribute "name"
